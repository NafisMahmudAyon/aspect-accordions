### Builder Interface

This plugin introduces a standalone builder for creating and managing accordions and tabs. Unlike traditional plugins that rely heavily on WordPress's default dashboard UI, the **Aspect Accordions** builder provides a sleek and interactive interface at:  
**`http://localhost/wp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=aspect-accordions`**  

Here, you can:  
- Design and preview your accordion or tab layouts in real time.  
- Manage all customization options from a single, intuitive interface.
